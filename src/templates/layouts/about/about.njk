                <h4>Hack on the Scruffy City</h4>
                <p>During 28 caffeine-filled, sleepless hours, members from the Greater Knoxville community will
                    brainstorm, build, break, test, and deploy whatever they can imagine, for the chance to win amazing
                    prizes.</p>

                <p>There will also be plenty of time to interact with professional mentors and engineers, meet
                    recruiters, and listen to great tech talks and tutorials from sponsors.</p>
